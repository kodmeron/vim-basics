## How to insert an image in markdown
#Quick tutorial

This is a quick guide on how to make it work. No fuzz, just how to put memes inside an .md file such as this one:

<img src="https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/4105d28f45566683f9800958847c4664.jpg" alt="mouth girl meme" style="float: left;" />

You can use standard HTML. Inline styling for CSS properties is allowed.


#View example below:

```HTML
<img src="<YOUR-DIRECT LINK>" alt="<IMAGE-DESC>" style="<YOUR-STYLE>" />
```
